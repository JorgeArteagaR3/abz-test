                    What defines a good front-end developer is one that has
                    skilled knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS with a vast understanding
                    of User design thinking as they'll be building web
                    interfaces with accessibility in mind. They should also be
                    excited to learn, as the world of Front-End Development
                    keeps evolving.
